      <div>
        <p>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance.</p>
        <p>
          These are the three key factors when measuring the sustainability and
          ethical impact of an investment in a business or company.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a set of standards for a firmâ€™s operations that investors use to
          screen potential investments for their impact on these critical areas.
